## PySpark vs SparkSQL Usage in Databricks Cheat Sheet

## PySpark

### When to Use
- Complex data transformations
- Machine learning workflows
- Integration with Python libraries
- Complex ETL processes
- Streaming applications
- Interactive data exploration in notebooks

### Strengths
- Flexibility and full programming capabilities
- Access to MLlib for machine learning
- Integration with other Python libraries
- Powerful for complex, multi-step data processing
- Good for data scientists and Python developers

### Example Use Cases
- Applying custom algorithms to data
- Building and deploying machine learning models
- Complex ETL jobs with multiple data sources
- Real-time data processing with Spark Streaming

### Code Snippet
```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, udf
from pyspark.sql.types import IntegerType

# Define a UDF
@udf(IntegerType())
def multiply_by_two(x):
    return x * 2

# Apply the UDF to a DataFrame
df = spark.table("my_table")
result = df.withColumn("doubled", multiply_by_two(col("number")))
result.show()
```

## SparkSQL

### When to Use
- Simple to moderately complex queries
- Working with structured data
- Data definition and manipulation (DDL/DML)
- Performance-critical operations
- Integration with BI tools
- Ad-hoc queries and reporting

### Strengths
- Familiar SQL syntax
- Often better optimized (via Catalyst optimizer)
- Easier for SQL experts and data analysts
- Good for quick data exploration
- Direct integration with many BI tools

### Example Use Cases
- Data aggregation and summarization
- Joining multiple tables
- Creating and managing table structures
- Generating reports
- Quick data exploration

### Code Snippet
```sql
-- Creating a view
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY VIEW my_view AS
SELECT 
  category,
  AVG(price) as avg_price,
  COUNT(*) as product_count
FROM products
GROUP BY category
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10
ORDER BY avg_price DESC;

-- Querying the view
SELECT * FROM my_view WHERE avg_price > 100;
```

## Best Practices
1. Use SparkSQL for initial data prep and exploration
2. Switch to PySpark for complex transformations
3. Leverage SparkSQL within PySpark using `spark.sql()` or temporary views
4. Use PySpark for User Defined Functions (UDFs) when needed
5. Consider performance: SparkSQL often outperforms equivalent PySpark code
6. Choose based on team expertise and project requirements

Remember: The best approach often involves using both PySpark and SparkSQL together, leveraging the strengths of each for different parts of your data pipeline.
